- 👋 Hi, I’m @williamit2060
- 👀 I’m interested in the evolution of culture and internet technology, as well as the scientific study of consciousness/intelligence.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build a prototype collective intelligence.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating the first overt, online collective intelligence (*bc all intelligence is collective), based on user input.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me at williamit2060@gmail.com, or willgteach@gmail.com, or msg me on github.
